The racoon, with its mask of black and white,
Sneaks and scavenges late at night.
With nimble paws, it rummages through trash,
Looking for a tasty snack without a fuss.

In the dark, it scurries along the ground,
With a rustling sound as it moves around.
Its beady eyes glance left and right,
As it searches for a bite to eat tonight.

The racoon's fur is thick and gray,
A little bandit in its own way.
It waddles on its tiny feet,
A little fuzzy thief without a beat.

Oh, racoon, why do you trouble us so,
Making a mess everywhere you go?
Despite your mischief and your tricks,
We can't help but love your wily antics.
