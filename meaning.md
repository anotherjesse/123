Graceful and lean, with slender frame,
The whippet runs with lightning fame.
Smooth coat shimmering in the sun,
This gentle creature loves to run.

With eyes so bright and full of life,
The whippet’s heart is free from strife.
Ears perked up, tail held high,
He gallops through the fields with a sigh.

So playful and loving, he’s a friend,
A faithful companion ‘til the end.
And when the day is said and done,
The whippet rests until the morning sun.

Oh, whippet, how we adore you,
Your spirit wild and true.
May your racing paws never tire,
And your heart always be filled with fire.
